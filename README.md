# Automatic-Regulation-Of-Water-Valve: Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the cropin a piped and microirrigation network of irrigation

# Introduction:
This project presents an innovative approach to automate and optimize plant watering using artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system incorporates NodeMCU (ESP8266) as the IoT device, various sensors for monitoring environmental conditions (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall), an LCD display for local feedback, and cloud integration through ThingSpeak. Additionallya laptop analyzes historical sensor data from ThingSpeak, predicting optimal watering conditions and controlling the water pump and valves accordingly.

Furthermore, a mobile app provides a user-friendly interface to monitor real-time sensor data, receive alerts, and manually control the watering system. The integration of AI, IoT, and cloud technologies enhances the scalability, flexibility, and intelligence of the plant watering system, contributing to sustainable and automated agricultural practices
